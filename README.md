This device aims to assist in automizing nitrate readings for pore water samples at lower costs. The code for the device where it automatically collects samples, creates the reagent-pore water sample mix based on the 9:1 ratio, and take the spectrophotometer reading one a day is given in the daily_once code in this github. It can be modified according to adjustments and changes made depending on what you would like to use this device for. The amount of time each vacuum is run for can be changed if required, and may be required, depending on the user. The circuit diagram for the PCB and Arduino Mega microcontroller being used is also available in this github.
